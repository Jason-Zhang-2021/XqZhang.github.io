When I was an undergraduate student, I learned the value of perseverance and collaboration in achieving goals through several competitions. As a first-generation college student from China, my early academic life was focused intensely on preparing for the college entrance exam, a test that would determine my future opportunities. Although my performance did not reach the level required for admission to a top Chinese university, this setback strengthened my determination to excel academically. To hone my expertise, I focused on developing both technical and teamwork skills, ultimately leading my team to win the first-ever national first prize for my university in the China College Students Engineering Practice and Innovation Capacity Competition. Recognized as a city-level outstanding graduate, awarded to the top 2% of students, I also earned an exemption from the graduate entrance exam, which allowed me to pursue a master’s degree at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).

At SUSTech, I encountered professors with global academic backgrounds whose open-mindedness and unique insights profoundly inspired me. Their encouragement strengthened my resolve to pursue a PhD in the United States, where I could deepen my understanding of fluid mechanics, collaborate with leading researchers, and broaden my perspectives on global research challenges. My experiences at SUSTech have not only reinforced my commitment to academic excellence but also solidified my long-term aspiration to mentor students and help them realize their potential—just as my professors have done for me. One core lesson I’ve learned throughout my journey is resilience. For example, none of the professors around me had a smooth, straightforward path to success; their achievements were rooted in their resilience and persistence. Motivated by them, I have consistently worked to maintain a GPA above 3.5, contribute meaningfully to my research, and actively support my peers in their experiments. These efforts culminated in receiving the National Scholarship, awarded to the top 2.5% of students, further affirming my commitment to excellence.

Additionally, my experiences as a volunteer have fueled my desire to use my knowledge to benefit others. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I organized an outreach program with friends to support rural communities, providing introductory lessons in science, literature, and art to approximately 80 middle and elementary school students. Witnessing their shift from resistance to excitement for learning deeply reinforced my passion for teaching. Today, our program has become a model for local government-led student volunteer initiatives.
